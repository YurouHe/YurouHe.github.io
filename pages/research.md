["A vulnerability index for priority targeting of agricultural crops under a changing climate,"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03135-8) with Calum G. Turvey, Jiajun Du, and Ariel Ortiz-Bobea.

Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate a single-index polymorphic production function that relates agricultural output to temperature and precipitation. The advantage of this new approach to measuring agricultural vulnerability under climatic change is that a single-index measure of vulnerability can capture a range of climate responses including plateau effects. The approach identifies plateau effects in the crop yield-weather relationship and provides overall fits consistent with higher-order polynomial fitting. We apply the technique to corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton at the USA county level. We illustrate its computation and use as a critical policy variable.
